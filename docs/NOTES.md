## Project Setup/Folder Structure

* This project is setup using a simple client & server folder structure to keep things simple. client directory would contain the Frontend App and the server directory would contain the Backend App. The idea is to be able to run both Frontend and Backend apps using Docker compose locally.
* Ideally, a Monorepo approach using tools like [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) & [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) would be a good choice as well, as it would allow us to share re-usable components or common modules like Type Definitions among multiple projects.
